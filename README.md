# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose: Loise's play almost reached its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. To help Louis identify how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch date and their funding goals, we analyzed several other campaigns and their successes, failures, and cancellations by month and also by the funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: The most successful launches are in May. ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://github.com/becca0316/Kickstarter_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: The most successful fundraising goals are less than $1000. ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://github.com/becca0316/Kickstarter_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered: One challenge I encountered was using the "Countifs" formula to find data in between ranges (i.e. >1000 < 4999). When I was entering the formula I kept getting errors because I was not adding commas in between the ranges and I was not separating the ranges. In using the Microsoft Support webpage, I was able to solve the issue and was able t get the right data without error message boxes.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? There are 3 spikes in the graph depicting an increase in successful outcomes. Biggest spike is in the spring time, with the peak being in the month of May. The most successful launches are in May. Based on the graph, the least amount of successes were in the month of December, with the line graph trending in a downward direction.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? The most successful funding goals are less than $4999, with less than $1,000 being most successful (76%) based on the trends of the graph. The least successful had goals between $45,000 and $49,999 with 0% success. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset? The limitations of this data set are that it does not include variables explaining why or how campaigns were either successful or failures. This dataset provides objective information and provides a baseline of when to launch and the fundraising goal, but not how.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Other possible graphs that we could create are bar graphs analyzing the successful campaigns based on location to identfy where the plays are most successful. Another chart we can do is a line graph to analyze how many backers successful plays had to identify how much support is needed to have a successful play.
